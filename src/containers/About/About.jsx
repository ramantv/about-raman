            In my spare time I love to play Tennis. I also coach a little
            Tennis, to my son and other kids in the neighborhood. I enjoy going
            on long walks with Rafa (my black Lab). I love to travel,
            particularly like to visit the great National Parks in America and
            around the world. I also enjoy reading and occasionally like to
            experiment in the kitchen with different recipes and subjecting my
            family to the results of my experiments.ðŸ˜Š
